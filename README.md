# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The reading and tidying of data is performed by the **run_analysis.R** script.

See the **Code Book** for details about the data and the script.

### Assumptions

This script assumes it is located in the same directory into which the [data set][1] has been extracted.

It is also assumed that the **reshape2** package has been installed.
